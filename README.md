Hello from PonyTown!

♡》You can call me Batty/Bugs/Rem — or anything really. I'm 21+. She/Her. I'm really only on the SS2, but I'll occasionally pop in to SS1.

♡》I often have DNI, but ultimately please int with EXTREME CAUTION. I get nervous very easily and sometimes when I make new friends I immediately skitter away because I get so anxious. I am sorry ahead of time! /gen

♡》Please don't copy my ponies; ask for inspo!

♡》 I do NOT do ships, you will be blocked if you attempt.

♡》 Please ASK to cover me and/or to C+H. If anything just please keep from covering my face 🫂 thank you.

♡》I do use tone-tags, but mostly the basic ones like /lh, /j, /gen, /nm, /srs

***♡》Tenna as a whole has become very important to me, please keep in mind this character has become my secondary safe space and I'm protective of it (yes. I do touch grass. I'm just unwell ❤️‍🩹)***

Some extra DNI(s)/info:

♤》I greatly do not like, honestly, any Tenna ships! Especially Spamtenna. My experience with it was bad and it's often came off to me as a f—tish ship than anything. Please DO NOT bring that around me.

♤》I have and do block any Tenna/Spamton ponies I see, it's nothing against the person I just am deranged and these two goobers are important to me! (And most, as previously stated, are Spamtenna ships 💔)
